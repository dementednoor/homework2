Running script command should look like this:

`python   trace_error_checker.py   path_to_dir_with_btf_file    path_to_output_error_file  ` 
(spaces are for better visibility)

for example:

`python   trace_error_checker.py /home/user/hw/ /home/user/hw/error_report.txt`

**hw directory** holds the **Demo_Exercise_Trace.btf** (script doesn't ask 
to include the filename to the path, cause we consider the name of the file is 
always the same). Output file's name is up to user, so he can specify it by 
himself.

Running tests is similair:

`python   test.py    path_to_dir_with_btf_file`

for example:

`python   test.py    /home/user/hw/  `


User only has to specify path to the btf file directory, because output file 
isn't tested.
